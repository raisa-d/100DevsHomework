// TASK 2: Character Inventory
/*
Improve the example RPG to add character inventory management according to the following rules:

- A character's inventory contains a number of gold and a number of keys.
- Each character begins with 10 gold and 1 key.
- The character description must show the inventory state.
- When a character slays another character, the victim's inventory goes to its vanquisher.
