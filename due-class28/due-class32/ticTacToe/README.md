<ul>
  <li>JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3</li>
  <li>Version Control: Git</li>
</ul>

## Optimizations
The next iteration will focus on prioritizing the following udpates:
- Once one player wins the game, they should no longer be able to select more boxes (if there are free ones).
- Add styling for when the winner wins, highlight the winning combination.

Future steps:
- Adding the option to play against a bot (right now players can play side by side with another human).

## Lessons Learned
<p>We worked on this in collaboration and it was a learning curve working with multiple collaborators in GitHub. In the end, I added my team member as a collaborator to the repository, they forked the repository and submitted a pull request from there.</p>
<p>Using Object-Oriented Programming principles was also a learning experience. We opted to create a Game class with a game loop to run the game, which calls different methods within the Game class.</p>
