  Blackout Poetry Studio is a web app that enables users to create blackout poetry, a type of found poetry. Users begin with a base text and create a new poem by selecting which words they want to keep from the pre-existing text and then blacking out the rest.

## Development Stage 
- Current functionality includes the ability to: 
  - generate a random poem
  - search for a poem by title and get back the first one found (next iteration will give multiple options if there are any for user to choose from)
  - create a blackout poem using custom text
  - select which words you want to be in your poem
  - black out the rest of the words to create the poem
  - reset the poem so no words are blacked out or selected anymore

## Next Steps/Features to Implement
1. Save progress in local storage so it doesn't delete user progress if they refresh it
2. Search functionality to get poem by searching the database by keyword, author, etc.
3. Save and share your poem
4. Add an 'edit' button to edit a poem after you've blacked it out
5. Add ability for user to change font-size and font-family of poem
6. Styling
   - add dark mode
   - make it so the words that aren't blacked out have more padding so it doesn't look weird in smaller viewport sizes
7. Animations
   - have expandable elements smoothly transition

## APIS being used
